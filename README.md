### About the webpage  
This project is the webpage for computer graphics course. After learning bezier curve, I decided to make a visual webpage, which is for students to know what a cubic bezier curve will be like.  
You just need to input these coordinates for the points and then click the button RUN, the curve will be shown in the canvas.
